# Diabetes Predictor

## Project Overview

The Diabetes Predictor project focuses on developing a predictive model for diabetes detection using advanced Machine Learning algorithms. Leveraging the power of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbour, and Random Forest, our goal is to create an accurate and reliable tool for early diabetes prediction.

## Technologies Used

- Machine Learning
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbour
- Random Forest

## Key Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Approach:** Utilized Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbour, and Random Forest algorithms to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the diabetes prediction model.

- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** Conducted comprehensive data analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering to ensure the model is trained on high-quality, relevant data.

- **Model Evaluation:** Employed various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to thoroughly evaluate the performance of the developed model.

- **Application in the Medical Field:** Demonstrated a strong understanding of classification algorithms and their application in the medical field, particularly in the early detection of diabetes.
